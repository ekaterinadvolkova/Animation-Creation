### UIViewProperty Animation
| Description   | Result Screen  | 
| ------------- | -------------  | 
| __1.__ The controller is ````UIViewPropertyAnimatorController````.<br><br>__2.__ The controller has one outlet ````animationView````.<br><br> __3.__ ````UIPanGestureRecognizer```` is added to the root view. <br><br> __4.__ Moving the finger horizontally on the root view should cause <br>the ````animationView```` follow the finger. <br><br>__5.__ The movement should be along the ````X````-axis with simultaneous rotation <br>around the ````Z````-axis and zooming of the ````animationView````. <br><br><br>__After removing the finger from the screen:__<br><br> __1.__ If the ````x````-coordinate of the center of the ````animationView```` is smaller than <br>the ````x````-coordinate of the center of the root view, then the ````animationView```` <br>should animatedly return to its original position.<br><br> __2.__ The ````animationView```` animatedly moves to the end point of the animation. <br><br><br> __6.__ Use the position property of the presentation layer to determine the center of the <br>````animationView````.<br><br> __7.__  Use the position property of the presentation layer to determine the center of the <br>````animationView````.<br><br>  __8.__ The ````animationView```` itself should rotate 180째 around the ````Z````-axis clockwise. <br><br> __9.__ The scale of the ````animationView```` should increase by 1.5 times.<br><br> __10.__ The ````timingParameters```` should be ````UISpringTimingParameters```` with the following <br>values: ````mass: 2.0, stiffness: 30.0, damping: 7.0, initialVelocity: .zero.````.| <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62830083/198134468-6f382e7e-415b-4dba-a1fb-f7c7c6f215d8.gif" height = 415, width = 200>|
